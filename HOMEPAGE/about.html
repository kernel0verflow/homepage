        <h2>So? Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Marcel, I am 24 years old and I am from Germany. I am interested in computer science and programming. I also love to learn new things and deal with complicated topics.</p>
        <h2>Why I created this Webpage?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I decided to create this in June 2022. I strongly believe that every person on this planet should have their own website! I have several reasons for this. I am a big privacy advocate and don't like to share my data with big companies. However, this is the case when using social media services.</p>
        <p>On a self-designed and hosted website, you have all the freedom. You want to build a chat room or start a blog. All this is possible with the help of a personal page. Or you can create a personal online diary, without the control of large IT corporations.</p>
